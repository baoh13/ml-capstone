## Project: Capstone Proposal & Capstone Project

**Note**

Customer acquisition process is vital for companies to grow their customer base. Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics challenge us with a real-life data science task to analyse demographics data of a mail-order sales companyâ€™s core customers in Germany and the demographics data of the general population to identify customer segments to target with their marketing campaigns. Furthermore, we also build a model to predict the probability of an individual to respond to the marketing campaigns and become a new customer. 

### Data

- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
